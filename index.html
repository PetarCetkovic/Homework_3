        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
                BitTorrent introduced the torrent phenomenon that continues to be one of the most hyped file transfer technologies among Peer to Peer (P2P) users. 
                It consists of sharing large files, like movies, software, or games anonymously and quickly with other peers. <br> <br>

                BitTorrent for Mac is one of the first ever BitTorrent clients, also available for Windows. <br> <br>
                
                Torrent sharing consists of sharing large files, like movies, software, or games with other peers. 
                The file you want to download is cut up into small segments shared by users, creating what is called a swarm,
                
                and does not go through a central server, significantly reducing the bulk of file transfers. <br> <br>
                 The Bittorrent client was actually the first P2P application to use this technology and became immensely popular
                  when it was released.
                
                Thanks to a straightforward, uncluttered interface BitTorrent for Mac appears as a friendly torrent client that
                 beginners will feel comfortable with. In fact, the latest version looks uncannily like uTorrentalthough the
                  functionality is nowhere near as good, unfortunately. <br><br>
                
                Once you’ve found the torrent you want, download it to your Mac, open it up inside BitTorrent for Mac and
                 let the client do its job. The speed at which you download will depend on the number of seeds, that is
                  people who have the complete file and are sharing it. The more seeds there are the quicker files will download. 
                  However, a frequent complaint with BitTorrent for Mac is that downloads rarely start and when they do, they can
                   be notoriously unstable. <br><br>
                
                You can improve things slightly by changing the settings of multiple torrent downloads but there are few diagnostic tools to help you work out the problem.
                 At the very least, you should choose the right port and setting upload and download rate limits to avoid 
                 hogging your bandwidth. It’s also good to set your downloads by priority to monitor more precisely how your
                  torrents are doing. <br><br>
                
                Compared to the exhaustive Azureus, Bittorrent is very simplistic. And compared to other alternatives such as uTorrent
                 or qBitttorent, it doesn’t work half as well despite similarities in appearance. It doesn’t provide many 
                 statistics and doesn’t let you customize the interface. Integrating a search box is a great idea, but it
                  limits searches to the BitTorrent website, not considered the most thorough source by torrent aficionados. <br> <br>
                
                Note that BitTorrent gives you access to a huge number of digital files and should only be used for sharing 
                legal P2P content. <br><br>
                
                BitTorrent for Mac may have once been a good starting point in the P2P world but there are now several
                 other clients which are far more effective. <br><br>

                secure trackers Improved rate limiting <br><br>
